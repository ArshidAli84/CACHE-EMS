# CACHE-EMS
Energy-Constrained Critical Load Aware Post-Disaster Home Energy Management (CACHE-EMS)

1. Run the python file (Generating_random_Loads and Criticality) that will give the output parameters for loads, criticaltiy and labels.
2. Copy it and input it to the main julia file
3. use the my_data.csv file and run the main formulation for CACHE-EMS.
4. This will give the output optimized values and plots.
5. To generate/visualize the increasing trend of natural disasters, run the python file (Natural_disasters_trend file) to visualize the trend from last 50 years. The data as csv file is also attached for or can be accessed online. While using this data/source, a credit to the authors/organization is mendatory.
